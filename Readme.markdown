# Features #

## Magiclly add icons and startup image ##

### Favicon ###
Simple place your ```favicon.ico``` file in ```img/``` directory.

### Apple touch icon ###
Simple place your icons in ```img/``` and name them ```apple-touch-icon[-<X>x<Y>][-precomposed].png```. (Use the App icon template to assist: http://appicontemplate.com/)

### Apple startup image ###
Simple place your your startup image in ```img/``` directory and name them ```apple-touch-startup-image[-<X>x<Y>][-landscape][@2].png```.

## WYSIWYG styles ##
By using the convention of using the prose class name to signal body-content, the WYSIWYG editor is automatically kept up-to-date in styles.
This is because ```sass/objects/_prose.scss``` partial is included in both ```screen.scss``` and ```editor.scss```, and the ```prose``` class is added to the WYSIWYG editor for you. You may still want to tweak ```editor.scss``` for some overall base settings.


## Cleaner and better WordPress HTML ###

### Menu class names ###
Add better class names to the menu items generated by WordPress.

### Remove gallery CSS ###
Remove the ```<style>``` added by the WordPress gallery.

### Make ```wp_page_menu``` better match ```wp_nav_menu``` ###
The ```wp_page_menu``` function almost matches the arguments and output as ```wp_nav_menu```, but not exactly which 
can lead to display errors when ```wp_nav_menu``` defaults to ```wp_page_menu``` when the menu is empty.

The options 'container', 'container_id', and 'container_class' are added to ```wp_page_menu```.

### HTML5 comments ###
The comment tree is generated with the HTML5 element of ```<article>``` with the help of the ```ZEROTHEME_Walker_Comment``` walker class.

### Header and footer templates ###
You should not need to modify the footer.php or header.php templates because they only handle the doctype, head element, body element, and html element.

To modify the start and end of the page, you can edit the body-header.php and body-footer.php templates.



## AJAX templates ##
Easy template AJAX callback.

1. Create a custom template in the ```ajax/<TEMPLATE_NAME>.php``` directory. You'll have access to all the default template stuff although there will not be any default loop context.
2. You can make an AJAX call for the template as such:

```javascript
jQuery.get( themeSettings.ajaxUrl, {action: themeSettings.themeAjaxAction, template: 'TEMPLATE_NAME'}, function( data, textStatus ){}, 'html' );
```

## Misc. ##

### Threaded comments reply Javascript ###
Adds WordPress' comment-reply script for moving the reply form below the comment replying to.


### Page titles ###
Adds a function ZEROTHEME_wp_title() with hook ZEROTHEME_wp_title to remove page title logic from the header.php.

### Login customization ###
Make your login page look like it is part of your site instead of WordPress. It will link the WordPress logo to your site - instead of wordpress.org - and change the tooltip text to your site name; additionally, it also includes ```css/login.css``` (```sass/login.scss```) to allow you to customize the styles.



## Helper functions ##

### Pagination for posts ###
Add ```ZEROTHEME_paginate_index_links``` function that wraps paginate_links to work to create pagers for index and archive pages.

### Load templates while passing variables ###

It works like the WordPress core ```load_template``` function but this takes an additional parameter of custom variables.

```php
<?php
ZEROTHEME_load_template( locate_template( 'custom-template.php' ),  array( 'foo' => 'The value for the $foo var in the template' ) );
?>
```


### Load a template part with multiple specialized names  ###

It works like the WordPress core ```get_template_part``` function but this takes an array for the ```$name``` parameter.

```php
<?php
ZEROTHEME_get_template_part( 'loop', array( 'single-event', 'event', 'single' ) );
?>
```

### Slugify text ###

1. ```$text``` string - the text to slugify
2. ```$options``` optional array - ```force_lowercase``` boolean to lowercase the text (defaults to ```true```), ```separated_character``` is a string to separate words (defaults to ```'-'```), ```accepted_characters``` is the regex to match words (defaults to ```'\w'```)

```php
<?php
$slug = ZEROTHEME_slugify( 'Magazine Name' );
echo $slug;
// magazine-name
?>
```

### Format array as HTML attributes ###

```php
<div <?php echo ZEROTHEME_get_formatted_attributes( array( 'class' => array('first', 'push1', 'span3'), 'id' => 'album', 'data-name' => 'french' ) ); ?>>
```




# CSS Conventions #

There aren't many CSS conventions that ZEROTHEME uses, it keeps a very small footprint on your styles. But there is one
to keep because it results in less work and better UX.

Use the class name ```prose``` to mark the element that contains body content such as the content of a post, page, or comment.
The first problem this solves is the issue with missing key styles for content because of a CSS reset.
The second issue is it makes it simple for keeping the WYSIWYG styles matching the actually results because ```prose```
class is added to the root of the WYSIWYG editor.

Place all the prose styles in ```sass/object/_prose.scss```. The ```prose```
